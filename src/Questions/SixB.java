/* ques 6
b)You are given an array of different wordsÂ and target words. Each character of a word represents a
different digit ranging from 0 to 9, and no two character are linked to same digit.
If the sum of the numbers represented by each word on the array equals the sum the number represented
by the targeted word, return true; otherwise, return false. Note: Provided list of words and targeted
 word is in the form of equation
Input: words = ["SIX","SEVEN","SEVEN"], result = "TWENTY"
Output: true
Explanation:
 s=6
 I=5
X=0,
E=8,
V=7,
N=2,
T=1,
W=3,
Y=4
SIX +SEVEN + SEVEN = TWENTY
650 + 68782 + 68782 = 138214
